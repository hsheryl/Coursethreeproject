##Study Design
=================
I downloaded the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and performed additional manipulation of it.  

The original documentation for the data set gives this description of the the study design:  

>block quote "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz."   

>block quote "Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag)."  

>block quote "Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals)."

##Description of Variables

The new variable names I created are listed below.  "activity" is the activity being performed by the subject when the measurement was taken.  "subject" is a numeric identifier for each participant in the study.  From the original variable names the prefix "t" ws expanded to "time", the prefix "f" was expanded to "force", the special characters were removed, "acc" was expanded to "acceleration", and "mag" was expanded to "magnitude".  Except for "activity" and "subject", the other variables are all means of either means or standard deviations that were estimated based on the original measurements that were obtained as described in the quotes above.

Variable names from the data set once it was tidied:
